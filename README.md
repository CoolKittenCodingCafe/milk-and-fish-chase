This is the repository of the video tutorial available on the Cool Kitten Coding Café YouTube channel. Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/DaTolXUwSyw) 

## Installing Python and Pygame
You will need to download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then Pygame using the pip tool as explained on [pygame.org](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). To get started with the Pip tool check out this [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), you might need to [upgrade pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#upgrading-pip).

## Newbies
If Python and Pygame are installed on your computer, but you have never run a game file and don't know how to do it, please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/DaTolXUwSyw).

*In this version of the game, the milk and fish are trying to avoid the cat. Feel free to play around with the code. Make them still, make them move differently, add more enemies, change the movements of the enemy, change the size of the sprites.
